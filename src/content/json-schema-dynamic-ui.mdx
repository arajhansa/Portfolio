In modern enterprise applications, form-heavy user interfaces are everywhere—from insurance onboarding flows to product configuration dashboards. As requirements become more dynamic and customer-facing teams demand rapid iteration, hardcoded form logic quickly becomes a bottleneck. At Kotak Life Insurance, we faced this head-on while building a scalable UI platform for the Optimus Portal.

The solution? **JSON Schema as the single source of truth for dynamic form rendering, validation, and code generation.** Here’s why this approach changed the game for us—and why it should be central to your next dynamic UI platform.

### The Problem with Traditional Form Architectures

Building forms the traditional way involves wiring up UI components manually, defining validation logic in code, and hoping the frontend stays in sync with backend expectations. This becomes unmanageable when:

- Forms vary across regions, user roles, or product lines
- Business rules change frequently
- Backend teams evolve the data models

We encountered this pain point in the insurance domain, where each policy product had unique attributes, validation rules, and logic based on the target demographic.

### Why JSON Schema?

JSON Schema is a declarative format for describing the structure of JSON data. Think of it as a blueprint that not only documents your data but also enables powerful tooling.

**Here’s how JSON Schema helped us:**

#### 1. **Declarative UI Generation**
Instead of writing custom React components for every new form, we built a generic schema-driven renderer. Given a schema, the UI renders itself:

```json
{
  "title": "Customer Details",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": { "type": "string" },
    "age": { "type": "number", "minimum": 18 },
    "email": { "type": "string", "format": "email" }
  },
  "required": ["name", "age"]
}
```

This schema maps to text fields, email inputs, number fields, and client-side validation—all without writing a single line of imperative UI code.

#### 2. **Validation and Consistency**
We used [AJV](https://ajv.js.org/), a powerful JSON Schema validator, to enforce rules both on the client and server. This ensured frontend-backend contract consistency and reduced mismatches during integration.

#### 3. **Open Source & Accessibility**
Our schema renderer was built on top of an open-source form library. We contributed components that emphasized clean design and accessibility, such as:
- Keyboard-navigable inputs
- ARIA-compliant error messages
- Reusable field layouts

This made our forms usable by a broader audience, including those with assistive needs.

#### 4. **Rapid Prototyping and Testing**
Need to test a new insurance product? Just create a new schema. We could go from concept to working UI prototype in hours instead of days. QA teams could test validation logic before backend services were even ready.

#### 5. **Schema-Based Code Generation**
We leveraged JSON Schema to auto-generate TypeScript interfaces, form configs, and even parts of our backend input validators. This eliminated repetitive boilerplate and improved type safety across the stack.

### Real-World Impact
By going schema-first, we:
- Enabled business teams to define new products with minimal engineering intervention
- Shipped forms that adhered to accessibility and UX best practices
- Reduced code duplication by over 60%
- Integrated seamlessly with visual LLM-based tools for analytics and automation

This approach allowed us to treat forms as data, not code—making them versionable, testable, and reusable at scale.

### Final Thoughts

Dynamic UI platforms are becoming the norm. If you’re still hardcoding your forms, you’re leaving velocity and flexibility on the table. JSON Schema offers a powerful foundation for building dynamic, maintainable, and scalable user interfaces.

So the next time your product team requests "just one more form," you won’t flinch—you’ll ship it before lunch.
